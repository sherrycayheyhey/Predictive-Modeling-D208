    "predictive analytics is the process that aims to predict an event using historical data \n",
    "that data is gathered in the analytical basetable \n",
    "it's usually stored in a pandas dataframe\n",
    "the 3 important concepts in the analytical basetable are: \n",
    "- the population, the group of people or objects you want to make a prediction for (the donors that are in scope of recieving a letter), the basetable has one row for each object in the population\n",
    "- the candidate predictors, describe the objects in the population, info that can be used to predict  the event (variables like age, gender, previous gift could be used to predict whether someone will donate for a future project)\n",
    "- and the target, information about the event to predict, it's 1 if the event occurs and 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "predictive analytics can do things like help you to determine the donors that are most likely to donate (instead of sending letters to all donors, you could target those one's specifically)\n",
    "\n",
    "the basetable will be historic\n",
    "you can look at a similar event, like a different fundraising campaign in the past, then construct the basetable from the data available at that time, the target will be whether the donor donated for the historical campaign, the candidate predictors are derived from the information that was available at that time\n",
    "a predictive model will then be constructed that will link the candidate predictors with the target in the basetable\n",
    "this predictive model can then be used to predict the current event, the candidate predictors are available and are used as the input for the model "
